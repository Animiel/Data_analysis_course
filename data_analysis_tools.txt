Tools used :


Jupyter Notebook (-> JupyterLab)
https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/
    CELLS
        Markdown -> text formatting tool
        Code     -> executes code like in VSCode
    MANIPULATING CELLS
        a -> adds cell above
        dd -> delete a cell
        b -> adds cell below
        m -> switch cell to Markdown mode
        y -> switch cell to Code mode (using Python language)
        r -> switch cell to Raw mode
        echap -> quit cell editing
        enter -> enter cell editing
        arrows -> move over cells
        ctrl + enter -> execute code cell
        maj + enter -> execute code and move to next cell
        z -> undo last action (no need of ctrl)
        x -> cut cell
        v -> paste cell
        c -> copy cell



Requests & Pandas libraries (-> included in Python)



Matplotlib
    Mostly used
    Static



(not used, but exists for better work)
Bokeh library (-> not included)
    Dynamic



NumPy (-> included in Python)
    Numeric processing library
    INSTALLING IT
        pip install numpy (in terminal)
        import numpy (in code editor)
    Used to run numeric code faster and improve CPU memory
    EXAMPLE
        python_array = [1, 2, 3] -> [[value, attribute, etc.], [value, attribute, etc.], [value, attribute, etc.]]
        numpy_array = [1, 2, 3] -> [value, value, value]
